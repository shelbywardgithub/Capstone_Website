                        A public network is a network, wireless or wired, 
                        that computers and devices you don't trust are 
                        connected to.
                        A public network does not require authentication or payment. 
                        Commonly, used public networks inculde bookstores, coffeeshops,
                        and libaries. Because anyone can access the network, it comes
                        with certain security risks. The data over this type of network 
                        is open connection and unencrypted, which makes it a target for 
                        hackers.
